# FuzzyMatch for Pinball Media

A simple python QT-based UI that perform fuzzy match (or best match) for renaming frontend media files such as Wheels, Playfield, Topper to Pinball Table names.

Best used in frontend like Pinup Popper because of the way it matches the media files. The media file has to exactly matched with the actual table names for it to detect.

Also helped me to learn about python QT framework.

# TODO
- Store each path per platform
- Show image preview for the selections

Heavily inspired by FatMatch Media Renamer by FatOne85 (https://gamingdoc.org/software/generic/windows/naming-tools/fat-match-media-renamer/). My FuzzyMatch differ from its program in the following aspect:

- Combo box selection instead of tree view
- Ability to enter folder path
